# This file can be used to pass defines for compiler

# Purpose is mainly to define user specific variables

# flags are passed for all build targets.

# Define need to start with '-D' keyword

### ONLY DEFINE ONE OF THE SWITCH ENCODING OPTIONS

# if neither of the below are set the code defaults to 1bit switches

# NB The TX and RX must be compiled with matching switch protocols!

# Sequential switches
# 5 bits are used in each rc packet to encode 8 3 position switches
# first 3 bits are the switch ID, followed by 2 bits for the switch value.
# Switches that have changed are given priority, otherwise each switch value
# is sent in round-robin.
# Channel 4 is reduced to 10bit resolution in order to get the 5th bit needed
# for sequential switch encoding.

#-DSEQ_SWITCHES

# Hybrid switches
# The first switch is treated as a low-latency switch to be used for arm/disarm.
# It is sent with every packet. The remaining 7 switch channels are sent
# in the same change-prioritized round-robin fashion as described for sequential
# switches above. All switches are encoded for 3 position support. All analog
# channels are reduced to 10bit resolution to free up space in the rc packet
# for switches.
